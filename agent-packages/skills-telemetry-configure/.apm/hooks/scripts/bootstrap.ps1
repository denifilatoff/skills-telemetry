# The hooks call the binary by its bare name (skills-telemetry ingest ...), so
# the binary must be a real command on PATH. This installer is the one-time
# provisioning step that puts it there: it downloads the release binary into
# %USERPROFILE%\.local\bin and ensures that directory is on the user PATH.
#
# It only installs. Provisioning, status, and every other command are the
# binary's job: call skills-telemetry <cmd> directly afterwards (by full path in
# the same session, by bare name once a new process picks up PATH).
#
# It is interactive (not a hook), so its own errors surface with a non-zero
# exit. Windows PowerShell 5.1 built-ins only. ASCII only: PS 5.1 reads scripts
# in the system codepage, so non-ASCII characters would corrupt the parse.
