# Install the skills-telemetry binary onto PATH, then optionally run it.
#
# The hooks call the binary by its bare name (`skills-telemetry ingest …`), so
# the binary must be a real command on PATH. This installer is the one-time
# provisioning step that puts it there: it downloads the release binary into
# ~/.local/bin, verifies its checksum, makes it executable, and ensures
# ~/.local/bin is on PATH.
#
# It only installs. Provisioning, status, and every other command are the
# binary's job: call `skills-telemetry <cmd>` directly afterwards (by full path
# in the same session, by bare name once a new shell picks up PATH).
#
# It is interactive (not a hook), so its own errors surface with a non-zero
# exit. POSIX sh; only built-in tools plus curl.
#
# The whole body runs inside main(), invoked on the very last line, so a
# truncated download (this script is meant to be piped into `sh`) can never
# execute a partial install: if the file is cut short, `main "$@"` is missing
# and nothing runs.
