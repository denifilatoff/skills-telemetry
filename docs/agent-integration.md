# Agent integration

How a skill run is caught in each supported agent. The shared path is the same
everywhere; what differs is the hook the agent offers and how much it tells us.

## The shared path

The hooks package
([`skills-telemetry`](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-ai-packages/tree/main/agent-packages/skills-telemetry))
registers one harness-specific hook. The hook calls the `skills-telemetry` CLI by its
bare name — `skills-telemetry ingest --agent=<name>` — so the binary must be on `PATH`;
the setup skill installs it to `~/.local/bin` and puts that directory on `PATH`. A bare command name is shell-agnostic, which is what makes one hook
work across every harness and OS (Git Bash, PowerShell, and `cmd.exe` on Windows; POSIX
`sh` elsewhere). The CLI reads the agent's payload on stdin, detects any skill that ran,
queues the event to an on-disk outbox, and flushes opportunistically over OTLP/HTTPS. It
always exits 0, so it never fails an agent turn. For its internals, see
[the skills-telemetry CLI](cli.md).

Detection uses one of two signals, depending on what the agent exposes:

- **Native event** — the agent names the skill in the hook payload. Exact.
- **Session transcript** — where there is no native event, the CLI reads the session
  transcript for the `SKILL.md` files the agent loaded.

Both transcripts are JSONL — one JSON object per line — and the CLI streams them line by
line, so a large transcript never loads into memory at once. The parse is fail-safe: a
missing file, an unreadable line, or an unexpected shape yields zero events, never an
error that could fail the turn. Because the hook fires every turn while the transcript
only grows, the CLI keeps a per-session byte offset (keyed `codex:<session>` or
`cursor:<session>`) and parses only the bytes written since the last run; an offset past
the end of the file means it rotated, so the CLI resets to zero. Within one parse, skill
names are deduplicated, so a skill read by several commands counts once. The exact match
rule differs per agent — see each section below.

The CLI does not rely on a marker printed into the model's response — see
[ADR 0001](adr/0001-skill-detection-via-hooks-and-transcripts.md).

## Claude Code

**Hook:** `PreToolUse`, matched on the `Skill` tool.

Claude Code runs a skill as a tool call, so the hook fires before the tool runs and the
payload names the skill. This is the native-event path: the CLI reads the skill name
straight from the tool input and needs no transcript fallback.

```json
"PreToolUse": [
  { "matcher": "Skill",
    "hooks": [ { "type": "command",
      "command": "skills-telemetry ingest --agent=claude" } ] }
]
```

## Codex

**Hook:** `Stop`, fired at the end of a turn.

A skill in Codex is not a tool and emits no activation event, so there is nothing to
intercept mid-turn. The `Stop` hook runs after the turn, and the CLI detects the skill
from the `SKILL.md` reads recorded in the rollout transcript named by `transcript_path`.

Each rollout line has a `type` and a `payload`. The CLI treats a skill read as a shell
command that opens a `SKILL.md`:

1. keep lines where `type` is `response_item` and the payload is a `function_call` named
   `exec_command`;
2. parse the payload's `arguments` (itself a JSON string) and read its `cmd` field;
3. match `cmd` against the skill path — capture group 1 is the skill name.

```
(?:^|[\s"'=/])skills/([^/\s"']+)/SKILL\.md
```

The match is on the path, not the reading command: Codex opens the file with `sed`,
`cat`, `head`, or `rg`, and the path is absolute in the desktop app but relative under
`codex exec`. The leading separator stops a directory such as `my-skills/` from matching.
The repository remote comes from the first line, `session_meta`, field
`git.repository_url`, which is read regardless of the offset. The full record is in
[the Codex session-parsing spec](superpowers/specs/2026-06-16-codex-session-parsing.md).

## Cursor

**Hook:** `afterAgentResponse`, fired after each response.

Like Codex, Cursor has no skill-activation event. The `afterAgentResponse` hook names
the transcript in `transcript_path`. Each line is a message with a `message.content`
array, and two content shapes count as a skill load:

- a `tool_use` entry named `Read` whose `input.path` ends in `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
  — an automatic skill load;
- a `text` entry that contains a `<manually_attached_skills>` block, where each
  `Skill Name: <name>` line is a manually attached skill.

```
(?:^|/)\.cursor/skills/([^/]+)/SKILL\.md      # Read tool_use input.path
^Skill Name:\s*(\S+)                          # inside <manually_attached_skills>
```

Unlike Codex, the transcript carries no git data, so the repository remote is resolved
from the hook's `workspace_roots`. The manual-block scan is gated on the block being
present, not bounded to it, so a stray `Skill Name:` line elsewhere in the same message
would also match — the cost is a spurious name, never a missed turn.

Cursor requires a numeric top-level `version` in `.cursor/hooks.json`, but a fresh
`apm install` drops it, which silently disables every project hook. Re-add it by hand
after installing until the upstream fix ships. The full record is in
[the Cursor hooks workaround](superpowers/decisions/2026-06-17-cursor-hooks-version-workaround.md).

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "afterAgentResponse": [
      { "command": "skills-telemetry ingest --agent=cursor" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## OpenCode (planned)

OpenCode is not shipped yet. It emits a native event: when skills are managed through
the `.claude/skills/` compatibility extension, activation is a `use_skill` tool call
caught by the pre-tool-call hook, with the skill name in its arguments — the same
native-event path as Claude Code.
